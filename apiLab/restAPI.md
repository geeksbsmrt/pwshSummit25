## Workshop Description

Take your automation skills to the next level by becoming an API developer! This half-day workshop is designed for automation specialists and PowerShell scripters who want to break into API development. Together, weâ€™ll build a practical .NET Minimal API from scratch, diving into the core skills needed to transition from writing scripts to designing robust, scalable APIs. Through hands-on exercises, attendees will learn about RESTful API design, managing HTTP requests and responses, and best practices for making APIs secure and consumable. By the end of this workshop, participants will have built a functioning .NET Minimal API and gained the confidence to expand their automation skills into the world of API development.
