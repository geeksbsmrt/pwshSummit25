## Session Description

It's 2025 and everything we do is now "as code" which gives us all the benefits we want - source control, repeatable deployments, change detection etc. So why are we still stuck with ClickOps for managing our devices with Intune & ConfigMgr? In this session we will have a frank discussion about the state of EUC management in 2025 and what possible avenues we have to leverage PowerShell (amongst many other tools) to drag device management into the modern era - whether it wants to or not!

By the end of this session you will have the tools and knowledge to understand the challenges associated with automating device management and how, using PowerShell, we can overcome them.

## Notes

- 100% Intune and Azure related
