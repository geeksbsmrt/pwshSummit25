# Mastering git collaboration

Speakers: Gael Colas & Raimund Andree
Room: 404
Time: 15:30 - 17:00

## Session Description

While git has become an essential tool for developers and IT Pros alike, mastering it remains a challenge for many. In this session, we will demystify how git enables collaboration by walking you through practical workflows and exploring popular branching strategies like GitHub Flow and Trunk-Based Development.

With a focus on PowerShell projects, youâ€™ll learn how to setup your repository's branching model, discover how to do artifact management, learn the differences between rebase, merge, squash, fast forward and what to do in case of merge conflicts.

This session will empower you to collaborate with confidence and enhance your team's development process.
