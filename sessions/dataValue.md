Speaker: Jennifer Stirrup
Room: 405
Time: 9:30 - 10:15

## Session Description

PowerShell and DevOps have become indispensable tools for managing and automating complex IT environments. However, as we harness the power of data to drive business intelligence and AI-driven insights, we must also address delivering value from the business impact of data. Delivering value means creating a culture that facilitates innovation and values trust, understanding, and care to create more innovative solutions and better outcomes for the business and the teams.

We will discuss practical strategies for building trust between development and operations teams, promoting inclusive design practices, and leveraging data-driven insights to enhance data-driven initiatives. Join us as we delve into the intersection of DevOps and building trustworthy data landscapes to deliver value to your organization as well as being a trusted partner of the business teams.

How can we build and maintain trust, understanding, and care in our data practices? Can PowerShell and DevOps principles be leveraged to create and build confidence in data management and analytics? This session will provide actionable insights for technical leaders and practitioners seeking to create a more effective DevOps environment with a focus on the following topics:

Building Trust Through Transparency - Implementing PowerShell scripts and DevOps pipelines to ensure data lineage, versioning, and auditability, fostering trust in data-driven decision-making processes.

Enhancing Understanding with Automated Documentation - Utilizing PowerShell to generate comprehensive, up-to-date documentation of the journey of data as it flows from the sources through to the users.

Demonstrating Care with Ethical Data Handling - Incorporating privacy-preserving techniques and compliance checks into DevOps workflows, ensuring careful use of sensitive information.

Delivering Value Through Intelligent Automation - consider how PowerShell can be used to integrate AI and machine learning models into DevOps pipelines, accelerating time-to-insight while maintaining data integrity.

Making your Data Stewardship Work - discussing strategies to embed data governance principles into DevOps practices, creating a shared responsibility model for a data platform for all.

Join us for practical insights into creating a data ecosystem that delivers business value and prioritizes trust, understanding, and care. This session will equip PowerShell and DevOps practitioners with the knowledge and tools to become data champions in their organizations, driving innovation while making data work for the organization.

## Notes

- Data validation prior to write
  - Example: Length of stay in hospital was in neg int.
    - Start\End date swapped.
      - Validate in form, validate in code, check once written.
- Use case matters
  - PlayDoh was originally a wallpaper cleaner but was failing and the wife of one of the inventor's took it to their Kindergarten class.
- Braning matters
- Build Trust through Transparency

"Innovation thrives at the intersection of people, process, technology, and data." - Annon

- Start as you mean to go on
  - It's hard to change course once started
- Small actionable goals
- Don't be afraid to fail
