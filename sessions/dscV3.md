# Desired State Configuration DSCv3.0

Speakers: Steve Lee & Michael Greene
Room: 401
Time: 11:00 - 11:45

## Session Description

Microsoft's Desired State Configuration (DSCv3) marks a significant evolution in cloud-native
configuration management for cross-platform environments. DSCv3 is a declarative configuration
platform. It's a tool for managing systems and applications by describing what they should look like
rather than how to make it that way. DSCv3 simplifies system and application management by
separating what to do from how to do it. Join Steve Lee and Michael Greene for a
demonstration-intense session on defining configurations and building your own resources. Stay for a
discussion on the future of DSCv3.1!
