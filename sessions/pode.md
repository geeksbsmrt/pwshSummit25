## Session Description

In this session, I will show you how to use Pode and Pode.Web to transform your support crew scripts into user-friendly web forms that your helpdesk will love.

You'll learn how to create interactive web interfaces that display results with buttons, checkboxes, and other essential elements. Our primary focus will be on automatically converting PowerShell scripts with multiple parameters into accessible web forms using the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

By the end of the session, you'll have the skills to enhance user experience and streamline processes by turning your scripts into efficient web applications, making it easier for your team to tackle everyday tasks.

## Notes

- Not as feature rich as PSU.
- Looks like it could use some more organization techniques
- Much simpler though
